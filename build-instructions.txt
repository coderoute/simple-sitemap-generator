Software Requirements:
Java 8

Build instructions:

1. You may skip this step if you have a recent version of gradle installed.
   Otherwise,
   On Linux or MacOS, please run
   ./gradlew wrapper
    OR
    bash gradlew wrapper
   On windows, always use gradlew.bat instead e.g.,
   gradlew.bat wrapper

2. Compiling and running tests
   ./gradlew clean build
   Alternatively, you can import the project in Intellij by importing build.gradle and running tests in the IDE.

3. Running application as standalone:
   First build a jar: 
   ./gradlew jar
   
    You may now run the jar passing in the starting URL for the crawler:
    java -jar build/libs/simple-sitemap-generator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar http://example.org/   

4. Troubleshooting
   In case of any issues running gradle commands on your system, use the flag --debug to get more information. e.g.,  gradle --debug clean bulid

   Alternatively, you may change the log level in logback.xml to DEBUG, the application will then log each
   newly discovered link as soon as it is crawled successfully.
